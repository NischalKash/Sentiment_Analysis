"4GB RAM NOT 8GB RAM!","This is NOT an 8GB RAM! It is only 4GB RAM! With that being said, it is advertised as an 8GB RAM, packaging was basically triple boxes, packaged very well! Came with backpack and mouse pad as described. Initial start up was slow, but moving fast now that it’s set up. Only gave 3 stars because the RAM is a significant part in purchasing the right laptop!","26 Nov 2019","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71T29bOsioL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Atara83","3.0","2019 HP 15.6 Inch HD Premium Business Laptop PC, Intel Dual-core i3-7100U, 8GB DDR4 RAM, 1TB HDD, USB 3.1, HDMI, WiFi, Bluetooth, Windows 10, W/ Legendary Computer Backpack & Mouse Pad Bundle","https://www.amazon.com/HP-Business-Dual-core-Bluetooth-Legendary/product-reviews/B07VMDCLXV/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Great Laptop, Good Value, well worth it","Amazon delivered my order promptly. This laptop bundle came in a solid double packaging, and it comes with a backpack and a mouse pad. I am so amazed by the backpack & mouse pad quality, and I don’t mind the little legendary logo both accessories. I had HP laptops previously and had been pleased with their performance. This one is exceptional for someone who isn't into a lot of gaming and such. I am self employed and I bought this laptop for my work, I only need basic internet browsing and need to do some basic excel reporting, so this computer is perfect for me and at an amazing price, especially it came with bonus accessories.","03 Sep 2019","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61+EuNBo3AL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Maggie","5.0","2019 HP 15.6 Inch HD Premium Business Laptop PC, Intel Dual-core i3-7100U, 8GB DDR4 RAM, 1TB HDD, USB 3.1, HDMI, WiFi, Bluetooth, Windows 10, W/ Legendary Computer Backpack & Mouse Pad Bundle","https://www.amazon.com/HP-Business-Dual-core-Bluetooth-Legendary/product-reviews/B07VMDCLXV/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Nice, but faulty!","I got a faulty laptop from day 1! Before I ordered I made sure to ask the seller if it’s NEW.  Well, I got it and it shuts down every 2 minutes. They offered refund, but I live outside the US and returning this mess will cost me a lot. I thought it was tested/upgraded as stated. How can they missed mines when it shuts off right after start up?

"Pretty much everything that i was looking for in a large laptop","the box delivered on time and safe.  it was double boxed and packed well. the included laptop bag is good quality and will work well when i need to use it.  i would not buy this laptop for the bag but it is a nice value add. speed and response on this laptop is everything that i was looking for.  set up was easy and came 1/2 charged so i didn't have to immediately plug in. My only concern is battery life.  this is the largest laptop that i have ever had.  i use mainly for school and work.  i don't game or stream a lot of video.  but in the 4 hours that i have had the laptop open today, the battery has already dropped to 25%.  i don't know if that is to be expected with the multiple windows open and the large screen but i don't expect to get 8 hours out of the charge if i am on it.  I will keep the power cable near by.  if you are using less, you might make a full day on a charge.","31 Oct 2019","","","Yes","Gregg Stepp","4.0","2019 HP 15.6 Inch HD Premium Business Laptop PC, Intel Dual-core i3-7100U, 8GB DDR4 RAM, 1TB HDD, USB 3.1, HDMI, WiFi, Bluetooth, Windows 10, W/ Legendary Computer Backpack & Mouse Pad Bundle","https://www.amazon.com/HP-Business-Dual-core-Bluetooth-Legendary/product-reviews/B07VMDCLXV/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Worst purchase EVER!","Extremely dissatisfied with this laptops lack of speed and how low quality it looks and feels. It truly behaves like a 13 year old slow laptop and I have high speed internet. It lags and takes forever to turn on it is so slow that I can get most info on my cellphone so much faster. I tried twice to get Amazon to send me a new Factory sealed one and they sent two that had the security tape removed and laptop was not factory packed. If it wasnt too late to return this I would do it in a heartbeat! Worst purchase of 2019 hands down! UPDATE* May of 2020 I DO NOT recommend buying this at all! It is absolutely the worst laptop I have ever had the displeasure of using/unfortunately owning! If you want to feel like you're on the first dinosaur slowest laptop ever made, then feel free to throw away your money on this monstrosity! You have been warned!

"what looked like old dust inside the phone","The phone I received has corrosion all around the USB terminal, what looked like old dust inside the phone, has rubber defects/peeling off around the camera lens, has rubber or plastic covering part of the upper portion of the rear speaker, has a spot/smudge that shows up when you take pics.  The phone has locked up twice when transferring content using PC suite to where it could not be restarted without removing the battery and 3 times it has went from full charge to fully drained for no reason.  The phone does have some good features like being a nice business phone and buttons are clearly laid out.  I have not been able to install Nokia maps and have had some other issues installing software.  Camera is decent but way to loud when you take a pic and so far I have not seen a option to mute it like you can on most phones, just different tones.  I hope that the condition of the phone is not typical of Nokia's, it has not been my previous experience with Nokia so I would just blame the seller for apparently selling damaged/refurbished phones as new and using a old dying battery.  Buyer beware of certain sellers.  I have include pictures of the phone and the condition.","19 Nov 2016","","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61a5RoOsecL._SY88.jpg

"Despite the other bad reviews, I bought this phone and did not regret it","I don't understand why so many people are complaining about the firmware. The phone had no problems at all from the beginning when I got the device. I did update the firmware two times (one for each time a firmware was released) and I don't notice any improvements either. Well, based on my experience with the Nokia E90, Touch Pro2, HTC HD2, Apple iPhone 3G, Sony Ericsson Xperia X1, and the Nokia N95, I really think this is the best phone out of all of them. 1) Build Quality - The build is alright. There are no wobbly parts (not even the battery cover which people complain about). There is some light leakage on the the upper 'functionality' keys and it is distracting. All Nokia E72's have light leakage here. The Micro SD and USB covers are easily damaged, so you need to be careful when you pry them open. I have not broken these but I can tell that they can snap off easily. But in the end, the build quality on the E72 is very nice and sturdy. The screen also comes with a pre-installed screen protector that can be pealed off. 2) Efficiency - This phone does not disappoint in making yourself more productive. The phone is very fast compared to Nokia N95, Nokia E90, and Xperia X1. The back-lighting on the QWERTY keyboard has the perfect brightness. It is much brighter than the Nokia E90's dim keyboard. Because the keyboard lacks a number row and needs larger keys, the Nokia E90 or Touch Pro2 is a better choice if you really need a really good keyboard. However, I was willing to sacrifice the awesome Nokia E90 keyboard to compromise for E72's better features and not-so-bad keyboard. From best to worst, here is how I rank between different keyboards: HTC Touch Pro2 > Nokia E90 > Nokia E72 > HTC HD2 > Apple iPhone > Xperia X1. You will never accidentally turn on your phone and dial numbers when you leave the E72 in your pocket. The phone will never unlock in your pocket (as long as you manually or automatically lock the screen). Most importantly, the Nokia E72 has a better keyboard and better buttons than the E71. There really only is one thing about the E71 keys that are better than the E72 keys. Since the E72 has a mushy optical sensor, using the D-pad isn't fun. The Nokia E71 has a better D-pad (it's more clicky and less mushy). However, the E71 'functionality' buttons are very cramped. I find it two times more efficient pressing the Menu/Calendar/Contacts/Messaging button on the E72 because the buttons are larger and raised. Even the surrounding buttons work well. On the E71 I would press multiple buttons at once. This problem rarely happens on the E72. In terms of the QWERTY keys, the E72 and E71 are very similar. However, the number and Ctrl key on the E72 is larger by comparison. So the E72 wins in terms of keyboard and buttons. 3) Battery Efficiency - The brand new battery on the E72 lasts much longer than the all of the phones I've had and used. Furthermore, it is easy to remove and replace, unlike the Nokia E90 and Xperia X1. 4) Camera - The camera isn't that good. I still haven't found a phone with a camera that's worth using. From what I can see, I don't think their is much difference between Nokia E72 and Xperia X1's camera. However, the LED flash on the E72 is the pretty good compared to other phone. Of course, I haven't used the camera that much and I am not a camera pro so you can't rely on me in this area. 5) Multimedia - the mono speaker on the back of the phone isn't very loud, but it isn't very quiet. It's much louder than the iPhone at max level but much softer than the Nokia E90 (which has amazing stereo speakers). The music player is great, and thanks to the keyboard, I can search through my music library without scrolling. Furthermore, the audio processing on this phone is on par to my laptop. I hear no difference in sound quality between my laptop and my E72 when I use the same headphones. Watching videos on the low-resolution phone is pretty decent and even clear, but because all Nokia comes with a terrible video player, I am disappointed. But thanks to how well a 600 qualcomm CPU performs on Symbian phones, multimedia is very breezy. 6) Phone and Organizer - this is an Eseries Nokia device running on symbian. Most Eseries organizer and phone software are same or similar. Well, in my opinion, the Eseries software is better than Windows Mobile and iPhone. Of course one of the main problem with contacts, calendars, and notes on non-touchscreen Nokia's is that you need a good keyboard to be well organized. Well the E72 has a decent keyboard. But in regards other than software, the loudspeaker/speakerphone is very low so conversations will be annoying because it's hard to hear when you are in a noisy environment. Do not get this phone if your priority is to have a good speaker for phone calls in public environments (for music is is decent, especially when you like to hear it in a quiet place). 7) Internet - the Wi-Fi browsing on this phone is much faster than the Wi-Fi on my Xperia X1, and E90. I can't comment on other phones. Scrolling through pages on the E90 was a nightmare. This problem is fixed on the E72. It also supports some flash content like you-tube, and for that, it is a very good phone for internet uses. For a non-touch screen phone, it's a good internet device. I actually prefer it over the HTC HD2. 8) Price - for 330 U.S. dollars. This phone has the most return to each dollar you spent. If you guys are wondering: A) The accelerometer works with 3rd party software but has pre-installed settings to silent phone calls or alarms. B) The annoying animated-transitions between screens can be disabled in the phone settings. C) Do not buy this phone just because it has a customizable optical D-pad. It's not very good, and the reason I like it is to lock in the 'focus' when I take pictures. D) The Calendar, Contacts, and Messaging keys are completely customizable.","31 May 2010","","","Yes","Peter Nguyen","4.0","Nokia E72 Unlocked Phone Featuring GPS with Voice Navigation - U.S. Version with Full Warranty (Zodium Black)","https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Phone-Featuring-Navigation/product-reviews/B002QEBM96/ref=cm_cr_dp_all_helpful?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending

"Excellent smartphone with a very professional look","Coming from a Windows mobile phone (HTC tilt), I love this phone. I have been considering the Tilt2, but wanted to try something other than a WinMo (I didn't find myself using a lot of WinMo features/apps that called for another similar one). iPhone was out of question as I wanted tethering, better battery life and dedicated keyboard. I have been using it for 3 weeks now and liking it more day by day. Few things before moving to Pros and Cons of the phone - This phone is not for people that like simplicity of touch screen phones (like iPhone). There is a learning curve in using this phone's features and the shortcut keys. But, imo once familiar with the functions/shortcuts one can do things a lot faster than a touch screen phone. Pros **** 1. Looks sleek and professional. Call quality is excellent and plenty loud. 2. Keyboard feels very good even though the keys are slightly smaller. They have a nice feedback when pressed. 3. Shortcut keys! There are quite a few shortcut keys on QWERTY keyboard to control phone functions and inside applications. While this feature has a learning curve, I found it very useful once learned. 4. Snappy performance. Very fast and responsive. 5. OVI MAPS for Free! - this is simply awesome. Now you can have a GPS with maps for as many countries as you need, for free!. Below is a mini review for this feature to explain it better. a. The GPS locks on the position very fast while using A-GPS. Most of the time within 10-15 sec I have a lock on the signal. b. GPS interface is very good and user friendly (I have used the latest Garmin and Magellan). c. Features include lane assistance, auto zoom in/out based on turns/directions, voice guidance, Speedometer, 2D/3D maps, route overview etc. d. The map size while getting driving direction is a bit smaller on E72, due to smaller screen. Pretty much only 2x2 inch space is used to show the map and rest is used for other information. It might look better on Nokias with larger touch screens. In spite of this, the auto zoom in/out makes it easier to view the map details. e. I compared it side by side with my Magellan and found it to be pretty accurate. E72 was faster in getting the signals (perhaps due to A-GPS) 6. Wifi - Works wonderfully and connects to my home network with WPA2 security without any problems. Once connected, I can turn off scanning to save battery Life 7. Screen is very bright and readable in direct sunlight. 8. Battery life - I can wait for 3 days (may be 4 if I wait for the phone to die on me) before I have to connect it to charger. I use Push emails (18 hrs a day) and stay connected to my home wireless network most of the time and occasional use of phone for talking. Even with heavy use I expect it to last at least for 2 days. 9. 3.5mm headphone jack 10. Comes with a 4GB micro SD card. 11. Decent 5MP camera and nice outdoor photo quality. Indoor photos are just OK (most cellphone cameras are the same). Cons **** 1. Screen resolution is not great when compared other similar type phones (E.g. Blackberry bold). Would have been nice to have higher resolution on such a bright screen 2. Speaker phone volume is not loud enough 3. Mail for Exchange - The version on phone is not bad, but it could be better. This is the only application that runs slow on this phone. It takes good few secs for it to open a mail. As it does not load the mail in HTML format automatically, the readability suffers. I had to scroll 2-3 pages to read a few liner mails. Got Roadsync (version 5) for discounted price from OVI store and loving it. It addresses all the problems with Mail for Exchange. 4. Optical trackpad is not very useful (even after setting sensitivity to high). I found using the D-pad quicker. 5. Micro USB connector and shortest cable - the USB cable that came in the box is approx 7inch long. For such highly priced phone it would have been nice if Nokia included a good quality longer cable. Also, I would have preferred a Mini USB instead of Micro. Micro USB feels a bit fragile and I feel like I might break it if I'm a bit careless when connecting. Perhaps, the thinner case was a limitation to include a mini USB. The phone crashed only once till date and that was when using the Mail for Exchange. I blame it on the application for the crash and not the S60 platform. Browsing experience is not as great a touch screen phone/phone with larger screen. But, there is always a compromise on size vs. features.","04 Feb 2010","","","Yes","SK","5.0","Nokia E72 Unlocked Phone Featuring GPS with Voice Navigation - U.S. Version with Full Warranty (Zodium Black)","https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Phone-Featuring-Navigation/product-reviews/B002QEBM96/ref=cm_cr_dp_all_helpful?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending

"1st Smartphone","So far I'm pleasantly surprised by this phone.  For years I stuck to very simple phones b/c 1. I have butterfingers and was scared to drop it and have it shatter and 2. I really didn't have a need for a smartphone.  Now I do. The phone took me a few days to get used to, but now I feel that it is very user friendly.  The camera is great! I really didn't expect the camera to take such nice pics, but it definately does. I downloaded a bunch of apps from the Ovistore that have worked well, esp. Skype.  The only downside is, that when I use skype too often, to keep in touch with my staff when I'm away from my desk or out of the office, the battery life diminishes quite quickly.  Otherwise the battery life has been great, even after a day at a festival taking snapshots all afternoon, the battery life didn't go down. I have yet to find how to copy my contacts from the SIM card onto the phone, but it's not a big deal.  It's just takes a bit longer to add details onto a contact than I would like. The browser works well, but any failures I would actually blame my service provider for, not the phone. The one thing that I do find faulty is the voice activation feature.  On one the side of the phone, are 3 buttons, the center one activates this feature, yet when I try to use it, it never works properly.  When I look up 'Lisa' I have to speak 'Laiza' just like the robot voice does... only then will it come close to pulling up the right contact info... It may just mean I need to tinker with it more, but so far it hasn't worked for me.","16 Mar 2011","","","Yes","MsDJ","4.0","Nokia E72 Unlocked Phone Featuring GPS with Voice Navigation - U.S. Version with Full Warranty (Zodium Black)","https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Phone-Featuring-Navigation/product-reviews/B002QEBM96/ref=cm_cr_dp_all_helpful?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending

"No perfect phone","I spent alot of time researching a smart phone which would fulfill my needs. Every phone I researched had adherants and detractors. I ultimately bought the E72 as it met the majority of my needs and wants. First, I could avoid paying smart phone rates for internet and messaging. The phone also comes with Quickoffice which allows me to carry reports and useful information with me at all times ( I am an older student who returned to school to become an RN and this application is great for reducing the bulk of stuff I had to carry). The symbian OS is very stable. WiFi is great. The raised letters on the keyboard mean I seldom make mistakes entering anything. Call quality is great. As for those who complain about a lack of intuitiveness to the OS, I found it relatively easy to learn. If you have had to use proprietary programs; there is a learning curve in how information is organized but once you understand their system it is easy. It took me about a day to get it down. If I am light on Wifi/Internet the phone runs about 3 days between charges. If I really push the phone needs a daily charge. There are many more features about this phone I enjoy that I just do not have the time to go into.THe biggest downside for me with this phone was the manual. It discusses complex tasks but glosses over the basics. Overall, for a smart phone the price is reasonable,CPU power means no lag, the quality is great, the applications in the phone and Nokia PC suite are easy to use. If what I described meets your needs you will be happy with this phone. I know I have no regrets and am happy with the E72.","24 Mar 2010","","","Yes","R.

"Nokia E72 review after 3 months usage","Most reviews on the web compare the E72 with the E71 and whether it is worth the upgrade. This review is from the perspective of a first time Nokia smartphone user who previously owned Blackberry and Windows Mobile devices. Compared to my previous phones, this one is definitely more responsive. I rarely ever wait for menus to pop up or applications to open. Also, I am big on multitasking, which Nokia does very well. I agree that Symbian requires some time to get used to, but the shortcuts really help. For example, switching applications by holding down the home button is great for multitasking. The phone itself is sleek and feels good in the hands. It has some weight to it so that it does not feel ""plasticky"". The thin form factor makes it easy to carry in the pocket. I'm not going to deny it, the light leak does bother me. It is something I am willing to live with, though, because this phone still looks better than the others in the market. The optical nav pad depends purely on personal preference. I find myself switching between the optical and physical button depending on the task. The optical pad is functional. I just find it a bit slow when scrolling down a web page. And Nokia really dropped the ball in making the surrounding D-pad button too high. It makes scrolling optically uncomfortable as you are constantly hitting the edge of the physical button. I really like how the notification light surrounds the D-pad. The white light looks good on the black phone. Much better than having a separate red LED in the corner of the phone. Now, if only that can switch colors... Call quality is good and I have no had any dropped calls. The one complaint is that the speakerphone is not loud enough. Email on the Nokia is also surprisingly good despite the bad reviews. I feel that it is as much as ""push"" email experience as the BB. Setup was pain free even for the casual user. I also like how you do not have to open the html version unless you choose to do so using the link on the top of the email. The one thing I miss from the BB is not being able to get all my email accounts and SMS in one folder. Nokia should really consider that. Also the copy and paste feature is not as good as the BB. I still cannot copy text while reading an email. I have to choose reply so that I can get to edit mode before copying. If somebody knows a trick, please let me know. The Symbian interface is still relatively old-fashioned and boxy. However, that also means it looks less like a toy. I like how the home screen shows the calendar items and to do list. When on the Blackberry, I had to sift through hundreds of themes to find one that accomplished this task. In terms of apps, I still find that the Symbian apps are a step behind the other platforms. At least in the US. I find A LOT of apps out there, but the quality falls short. For example, the Bloomberg app was much more functional on my Blackberry. The Symbian version is just awkward, with no easy way to refresh the data. Nokia does score with Ovi Maps, which is easy to use and very efficient. Hopefully, Symbian won't die out and people will continue developing apps for it. I cannot say much about the camera as I like using real cameras for my pictures. I took a few as test shots and they came out pretty good. The shutter is responsive, but the flash is slow. When taken in good light, the pictures were crisp with good color. Low light pictures were noisy as expected. I hope this review gives readers an idea of the usability of the Nokia E72. I admit some compromises were made to switch from my Blackberry, but overall, I am enjoying my experience with the new phone. I think productivity will increase as I gain experience on Symbian. The responsiveness and appearance of the phone really won me over. Plus I cannot stand carrying the same piece of plastic as everyone else.","11 Apr 2010","","","Yes","Reviewer","4.0","Nokia E72 Unlocked Phone Featuring GPS with Voice Navigation - U.S. Version with Full Warranty (Zodium Black)","https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Phone-Featuring-Navigation/product-reviews/B002QEBM96/ref=cm_cr_dp_all_helpful?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending

"Previous E71 owner New to the E72.","for a couple yrs i had the European made E71, before Xmas got the E72 , and i beleive its a smart move, better camera snd faster programming and the track ball thing is not bad either. I believe that Both Phones are better than any Blackberry thats been out there before and after the E71/72 came out. the keypad is more finger and thumb friendly no doubt, I can text much faster than ever. i also like the fact that i can utilize my front camera with out going into the internet share site just to see if it works. The Volume to me is much better, the speaker phone also is more user friendly as well. I wish there is more hardcovers out there for the E-72. oh yeah the Flash light is a good add as well. definately check it out if you like texting alot like me and being super interactive , good for work and even school as well.","18 Jan 2011","","","Yes","CrunkATL","4.0","Nokia E72 Unlocked Phone Featuring GPS with Voice Navigation - U.S. Version with Full Warranty (Zodium Black)","https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Phone-Featuring-Navigation/product-reviews/B002QEBM96/ref=cm_cr_dp_all_helpful?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending

"Terrible Apps","This E72 has features which require the d/l of apps. The d/l would not complete properly rendering some of the phone features useless. Apparently my version of Win 7 and OVI/Nokia don't get along. I had to return the phone. Just a note about returns. I had ordered a couple of accessories with the phone. I did not have to pay shipping to return the phone. However, I was charged $5.23 and $5.02 for returning the accessories which, of course, were useless w/o the phone. I was instructed not to ship back both accessory items in the same package, which would have saved me a few bucks. I am not complaining about the shipping charges but in the future I will make sure a product works as advertised before purchasing an accessory. Perhaps you may find this bit of info helpful.","05 Dec 2010","","","Yes","Duffer.","1.0","Nokia E72 Unlocked Phone Featuring GPS with Voice Navigation - U.S. Version with Full Warranty (Zodium Black)","https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Phone-Featuring-Navigation/product-reviews/B002QEBM96/ref=cm_cr_dp_all_helpful?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending

"Exceeded Expectations","This phone is awesome. I had an E71x from AT&T I sat on with my keys and broke the screen so I needed a new phone. I am over half way through my 2 years contract and didn't want to get tied back in for another 2 years with AT&T and I wanted a full keyboard phone. For $249 I decided I might as well stay with Nokia for now as I assumed the E72 would be pretty much the same as E71 (which was OK but not great) but the E72 is so much more. Each short cut button has a double function you can set - so for example the email button on a click goes into a screen that shows all my email accounts where as if I hold it for about a second I set it to go straight to sending an SMS. To call some one you can set the usual speed dials but for the rest you just start typing their name. No need to go to contacts first, just start to type the name - awesome! The free GPS is better than the GPS that came in my car. So far with email and Skype on the battery life has been good. The Camera Quality  is also excellent. There is plenty more - get one and see!","06 Mar 2011","","","Yes","Amazon Customer","5.0","Nokia E72 Unlocked Phone Featuring GPS with Voice Navigation - U.S. Version with Full Warranty (Zodium Black)","https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Phone-Featuring-Navigation/product-reviews/B002QEBM96/ref=cm_cr_dp_all_helpful?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending

"Awesome specs, awful, buggy implementation","Purchased the phone to replace an aging, kind-of crummy Windows Mobile 6.5. I received a beautiful specimen that I thought would last me a long time. How wrong I was! All was well until the a firmware update came out a few weeks after I purchased the phone, and my phone 'strongly recommended' me to update. Once I successfully updated, apps would stop working, I would get random lockups, and calls started to drop. Support is nonexistant with Nokia -- either you reach someone who can't help you, or you reach someone who doesn't speak English at all. Steer clear from the E72 -- it might seem nice and shiny, but it's a real dud.","19 Jun 2010","","","Yes","Chris W.","1.0","Nokia E72 Unlocked Phone Featuring GPS with Voice Navigation - U.S. Version with Full Warranty (Zodium Black)","https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Phone-Featuring-Navigation/product-reviews/B002QEBM96/ref=cm_cr_dp_all_helpful?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending
