• DevOps Intern at SYNTAX SYSTEMS                                                          (June - Dec 2019) 
‣ Built  Docker  images,  developed  containerized  Unit  Test  environment  (fully  automated)  to 
run in-production SaltStack formulas on/for various linux distributions.

‣ Wrote SaltStack formulas for installing & conﬁguring software agents/clients to connect to 
their respective in-production servers, and for modifying existing system conﬁgurations.


PROJECTS 
• Migration as a Service (MaaS) 

‣ Built and developed an integrated VM, Network and Container Migration Service for cloud 
platforms using pure Linux modules only.   Migration of tenant’s infrastructure to and from 
various clouds with Self-Healing, Accounting and Logging features.

‣ Ansible playbooks for automated infrastructure deployments, and  MaaS orchestration.


• Anomaly Prediction in Large Scale Distributed Systems 

‣ My role: Built a native Cassandra multi node cluster, with centralized monitoring server and 
deployed on Amazon EC2,. Yahoo Cloud Serving Benchmark as workload generator.

‣ My role: Docker containers for workload generation, metric collection & prediction engine.

‣ For Anomaly predictions used: Adaptive Growing Hierarchical SOM and LSTMs.


• Custom Unix Kernel 

‣ Built  and  added:  Exponential  Distribution,  &  Linux  Like  (kernel  2.2)  process  scheduling 
policies  to  address  starvation  problems;  System  Calls  for  additional  functionalities; 
Demand paging & Disk Emulation for better virtualization; Readers/Writer Locks to solve 
priority inversion using Priority Inheritance protocol to existing XINU OS kernel.


• Analysis of Configuration Management Softwares 

‣ Targeting  system  architects  &  software  developers,  compared  Ansible  and  Puppet  on 
service performance, usability, stability, robustness, etc. 

‣ Tools: Docker, Molecule, SonarQube, Pylint, RSpec. My role: Containerized testing using 
Docker, Code smell & bug severity, vulnerabilities using SonarQube. 


• Peer-to-Peer with Centralized Index System for Downloading RFCs 

‣ Built a P2P-CI system to download RFCs spread across peers with P2P (simple HTTP), 
and P2S (request-respond) Application layer protocols. 

‣ TCP communications between Peer-Peer, and Peer-Server.


• File Sharing between Remote Systems 

‣ Built a Remote Client & Server File Sharing system over UDP using Selective-Repeat and 
Go-Back-N ARQ protocols with checksums and packet drop probability factored in.


ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
• Paper Publication in 30th Computer Society of India’s(CSI) journal 2017 

‣ “E-forms in Banking System”- technical paper proposed to digitalize deposit section of 
Indian banks. Was 4th runner up of 32 papers selected (state level).


• IIT Bombay certiﬁed C/C++ programmer: 
funded by National Mission on Education 
through ICT, Govt., of India, 2017.
